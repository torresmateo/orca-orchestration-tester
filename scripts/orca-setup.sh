# Orca repo setup hook — runs once per worktree, before any worker starts.
#
# Wire it up in the Orca app: Repo settings -> hooks -> setup script:
#   bash scripts/orca-setup.sh
# Set the repo's setup policy to wait-for-setup, not start-immediately. An agent
# that begins before install finishes runs the tests against a half-installed
# tree, reads the resulting errors as a broken repo, and starts fixing what is
# not wrong.
#
# Two jobs:
#   1. Give this worktree a port block no other live worktree holds, plus a
#      Compose project name, written to an untracked .env.local.
#   2. Install dependencies, detected from whichever lockfile is present.
#
# Why isolation is the whole point. Several worktrees run side by side. Two of
# them running the same dev stack unnamespaced do not merely fight over ports:
# Docker Compose derives container AND volume names from the project name,
# which defaults to the directory name. Two checkouts of the same repo then
# share one database volume while believing they are isolated. That failure is
# silent and looks like flaky tests. So each worktree gets COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME
# as well as its own ports, whether or not the project uses Compose today.
#
# Compose does NOT read .env.local. Compose commands in a worktree need:
#   docker compose --env-file .env.local up -d
#
# Claims are host-wide (~/.cache/orca-portblocks) so worktrees of different
# projects cannot collide either.
#
# Idempotent: re-running keeps the block this worktree already holds.
